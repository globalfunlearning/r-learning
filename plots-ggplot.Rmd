# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)

ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))

gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

gg_base +
  geom_point()

gg_base +
  geom_col()

gg_base +  
  geom_area()

# Intro to customizing ggplot graphs

### Building on our first line graph, let’s update the line color to “purple” and make the line type “dashed”:

gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "purple",
    linetype = "dashed"
  )

Now let’s update the point, style and size of points on our previous scatterplot graph using color =, size =, and pch = (see ?pch for the different point styles, which can be further customized).

gg_base + 
  geom_point(color = "purple",
             pch = 11,
             size = 4,
             alpha = 0.5)


## Mapping variables onto aesthetics

In the examples above, we have customized aesthetics based on constants that we input as arguments (e.g., the color / style / size isn’t changing based on a variable characteristic or value). Sometimes, however, we do want the aesthetics of a graph to depend on a variable. To do that, we’ll map variables onto graph aesthetics, meaning we’ll change how an element on the graph looks based on a variable characteristic (usually, character or value).

In short, if updating aesthetics based on a variable, make sure to put that argument inside of aes().

Example: Create a ggplot scatterplot graph where the size and color of the points change based on the number of visitors.

gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )
  
Example: the fill color (argument: fill =) changes based on the number of visitors.

gg_base + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
