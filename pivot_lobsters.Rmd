remove NAs first before calculating the average:

lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE))


siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))


## make a table with our new variable
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()
  


There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report.


siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'site' (override with `.groups` argument)
